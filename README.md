The goal of this project is to detect presence of lung cancer nodules from respective CT scan images. The dataset used is a large collection of CT lung scan slices with ground truth values divided into training and test sets. A linear classification algorithm would be developed using this training data to classify our test CT scans to evaluate its accuracy.
